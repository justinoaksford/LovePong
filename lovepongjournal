    Trying to start up Love2d again; just want to do a little every so often. Going to start with pong.

	Am completely lost about where to start. Just jumping in and will fix things later. Making some Aseprite things and just poking around.

	I tried to skip steps in the tutorial and got stuck. Shouldn't do that again. Oops. Next time just follow the tutorial.

	55 minutes into this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfwpRU0cT10&t=1761s

	Getting a bunch of stuff to work, but frustratingly trying to figure out why the ball isn't operating right. I think it may be time to try and start the ball over from scratch to make sure I understand what's going on exactly. 

	HAHA just kidding. Writing this out helped me realized I was updating the wrong var in the render method.

	Stopping point; implementing colliders.

	Got collision and score incrementing in! https://youtu.be/GfwpRU0cT10?t=4481
	Playable. Nice. Just a little bit all the time.
	Want to try and add some VFX juice.
